    "The data used in this analysis was gotten from three different sources\n",
    "- A csv(comma separated values) file Twitter archive dataset which was readily available in the local environment named df_archive\n",
    "- A tsv (Tab separated values) file holding predictions data of tweets from the @WeRateDogs twitter account. The Dataframe was named df_pred\n",
    "- Data gotten through the twitter API using the tweepy library. it was named df_twt\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the data were from different sources. it was expected to have some issues of data cleanliness. Having that in mind, i merged the 3 dataframes into 1 and named it **df_master** using their common attribute which is the tweet_id.\n",
    "The df_master was assessed programatically and visually to check for issues of quality and tidiness. Some of the issues discovered are highlighted below:\n",
    "###### - Missing data\n",
    "###### - wrong Data type\n",
    "###### - complex data representation\n",
    "###### - outliers in some of the columns input\n",
    "###### - Not all tweets are dog ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "- I Made a copy of the master dataframe and named it df_master_copy. \n",
    "- I Dropped columns with missing data and columns associated with retweets as they were not valuable to the Analysis. - I Converted columns with wrong datatypes to their appropriate datatypes.\n",
    "- The columns with complex data representations are columns associated with [Doggolingo](https://zippypaws.com/blog/doggolingo-101-internet-language-of-the-dogs/) dog classification and data associated with prediction/classification of dog breeds. In both cases, the columns were made into one meaningful column.\n",
    "- In bid to rate more than one dog in a picture as one rating, @WeRateDog adopted a rating system(different from the standard) to accomodate all dogs in such picture by adding all the rating numerator of each dog as rating_numerator and multiplying the number of dogs by 10 as rating_denominator. E.g a picture of 5 dogs with rating of 12 each will be represented as 60/50. This system was what led to the anomalies found in those columns. The affected rows were assessed and modified by appending the average of the given rating_numerator.\n",
    "- Lastly, the columns that were predicted not to be dog i.e rows with p1_dog, p2_dog and p3_dog as all False were eliminated.\n"
